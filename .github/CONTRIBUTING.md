## Issues

Issues in [`MARKETProtocol/types`](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues) are the 
primary means by which bug reports and general discussions are made. A contributor is allowed to create an issue,
discuss and provide a fix if needed.

## Discussions And General Help

Please join our [Discord](https://marketprotocol.io/discord) channel for general discussions/help.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the way in which concrete changes are made to the code.

## Prerequisites

## Git Flow

We follow `git-flow` for branching.  For more info please [see our docs](https://docs.marketprotocol.io/#git-flow)

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types) and clone your
fork locally.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:username/types.git
cd types
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Step 2: Branch

It's always better to create local branches to work on a specific issue. If this issue is a new feature,
please name your branch `feature/featute-name`.  You can also reference the issue number if you like, `featute/feature-name#57`. 
Feature branches should be created directly off of the `develop` branch.

```shell
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature -t upstream/develop
```

### Step 3: Code

 
### Step 4: Commit

1. List all your changes as a list if needed else simply give a brief
  description on what the changes are.
1. If your PR fixed an issue, Use the `Fixes:` prefix and the full issue URL.
  For other references use `Refs:`.

    _Examples:_
    * `Fixes: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1`
    * `Refs: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1`

1. _Sample commit A_
    ```txt
    if you can write down the changes explaining it in a paragraph which each
    line wrapped within 100 lines.

    Fixes: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1
    Refs: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1
    ```

    _Sample commit B_
    ```txt
    - list out your changes as points if there are many changes
    - if needed you can also send it across as
    - all wrapped within 100 lines

    Fixes: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1
    Refs: https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/issues/1
    ```
6. [Squashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) and [Merging](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) your commits to make our history neater is always welcomed, but squashing can be handled during the merge process.

### Step 5: Rebase

Ensure your PR follows the [template](https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/types/blob/develop/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), so that it's
easier for folks to understand the gist of it before jumping to the
the code.

As a best practice, once you have committed your changes, it is a good idea
to use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to ensure your changes are placed at the
top. Plus merge conflicts can be resolved

```shell
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/develop
```

### Step 6: PRs

Please ensure that your pull request follows all of the community guidelines to include:

* Title is descriptive and generally focused on what the PR addresses (If your PR is a work in progress, include `[WIP]` in the title. Once the PR is ready for review, please remove `[WIP]`)
* Description explains what the PR achieves/addresses
* If the PR modifies the UI in any way, please attach screenshots of all purposeful changes (before and after screens are recommended)
* The PR passes all CI checks, to include `coveralls` and `Travis`.
